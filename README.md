Project features list:

Read and parse external file venues.json and display data
(Avatar shows since 2018 table on main page)

Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app 
(Click on 'Gallery' button on main page, takes you to Flickr photo albums) 

Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
(Countdown to next Avatar show on main page) 

Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that itâ€™s being saved/persisted
(Upon filling out the form and clicking submit, a popup button shows saying, "HEY IT WORKED! Click OK to see the results
on this nifty Google Sheet!' Clicking OK takes you to the Google Sheet that shows the data has indeed been saved
There's even a link in the Google Sheet that takes you back to the main page)
